DESCRIPTION
       Mixmaster is an anonymous remailer. Remailers provide pro­
       tection  against  traffic  analysis and allow sending mail
       anonymously or pseudonymously.

       In the non-interactive mode,  Mixmaster  reads  a  message
       from  its  standard  input  or  from  a file.  Destination
       address and input file can be  specified  in  the  command
       line.   If  no  address  is given in the command line, the
       input file is expected to contain a message complete  with
       mail  headers.  Messages to be send under a pseudonym must
       contain a Nym: header rather than From:.

OPTIONS
       -h, --help
              Print a summary of command line options.

       -t, --to=user@host
              Add the  destination  address(es)  to  the  message
              header.  The  input  file contains the message body
              without headers.

       -g, --post-to=newsgroup
              Add the newsgroup(s) to  the  message  header.  The
              input  file contains the message body without head­
              ers.

       -p, --post
              Post the message to Usenet.

       -m, --mail
              Send the message as electronic mail. (This  is  the
              default.)

       -s, --subject=subject
              Add the subject to the message header.

CONFIGURATION
       Mixmaster reads its configuration from the file mix.cfg in
       its working directory.  The configuration file consists of
       lines of the type

       VARIABLE values

       and of comments, which begin  with  a  #  character.   The
       variables have reasonable default values, but it is useful
       to create a configuration file using  the  Install  script
       when setting up a remailer.

       All  configuration  variables  can  be overridden from the
       command line, e.g.  mix -S  --POOLSIZE=0  --RATE=100  will

MIX(1)                                                     MIX(1)


              used where complaints about anonymous messages must
              be  avoided.  (The variable FORWARDTO specifies the
              remailer chain to be used; default:  *.)   Default:
              n.

       AUTOREPLY
              Send  help  files  in response to non-remailer mes­
              sages. Explicit remailer-help requests  are  always

       MIX    Accept Mixmaster messages. Default: y.

       PGP    Accept  OpenPGP-encrypted  Cypherpunk remailer mes­
              sages.  Default: y.

              Default: n.

       REMIX  Re-encrypt  Type  I  messages to other remailers in
              the Mixmaster format (x = only  when  requested  by
              user explicitly).  Default: y.

       BINFILTER
              Filter out binary attachments. Default: n.

       MID    Use  a  hash  of the message body as Message-ID, to
              avoid Usenet spam. Default: y.  If MID is set to  a
              string beginning with @, that string is used as the
              domain part of the message ID.

       AUTOBLOCK
              Allow users to add their address  to  the  dest.blk
              file  by  sending the remailer a message containing

       POOLSIZE
              The size of the Mixmaster reordering  pool.  Larger

       RATE   Percentage of messages from the pool  to  be  sent.
              Default:  100.   Lower  values  cause  the  pool to
              increase in size when many messages are recieved at
              a time, reducing the effect of flooding attacks.

       SIZELIMIT
              Maximal size for anonymous messages in kB.  0 means
              no limit.  Default: 0.

              POP3.   0 means no limit.  Default: 0.  Larger mes­
              sages are deleted unread if POP3DEL is  set  to  y,
              and left on the server otherwise.

       INFLATEMAX
              Maximal  size  for Inflate: padding in kB.  0 means
              padding is not allowed.  Default: 50 kB.

              How  often Mixmaster should check the POP3 accounts
              listed in pop3.cfg for new mail.  Default: 1h.

       PACKETEXP
              How long to store  parts  of  incomplete  multipart
              messages.  Default: 7d.

       IDEXP  Mixmaster  keeps  a  log  of  packet IDs to prevent
              replay attacks.  IDEXP specifies after which period
              of  time old IDs are expired. Default: 7d, minimum:
              5d.  If set to 0, no log is kept.

       The following strings must be specified at compile-time in
       config.h.   Usually  it  is not necessary to modify any of
       these:

       DISCLAIMER
              A default string to be inserted in  the  header  of
              all  anonymous  messages if no disclaim.txt file as
              available. If DISCLAIMER contains the substring %s,
              it will be substituted with the COMPLAINTS address.

       FROMDISCLAIMER
              A default string to be inserted at the top  of  the
              message  body  if  an  anonymous message contains a
              user-supplied From: line and no  fromdscl.txt  file
              is available.

       BINDISCLAIMER
              A string to replace the body of a binary attachment
              when the remailer is configured to filter out bina­
              ries.

       CHARSET
              The  character  set  used  for  MIME-encoded header
              lines.

       The following variables can be set in the Makefile  or  in
       config.h:

       PASSPHRASE
              A  passphrase  used  to protect the remailer secret
              keys from  casual  attackers.  You  can  use  `make
              PASS="your  passphrase"'  to set a passphrase. This
              should not be the same as the client passphrase.

       SPOOL  Set SPOOL if you want to use  a  default  directory
              other than ~/Mix or if Mixmaster is run in an envi­
              ronment where $HOME is not set, e.g.  when  invoked
              via  .forward.  This value can be overridden by use
              of the environment variable $MIX3PATH.

       USE_SSLEAY
              Use the SSLeay/OpenSSL cryptographic library.  Cur­
              rently  this is the only cryptographic library sup­
              ported by Mixmaster.

       USE_IDEA
              Use the IDEA encryption  algorithm.  A  license  is
              required  to  use IDEA for commercial purposes. See
              file idea.txt for details.

       USE_PGP
              Support the OpenPGP  encryption  format.  Mixmaster
              does not call any external encryption program.

       USE_PCRE
              Use the regular expression library.

       USE_ZLIB
              Use the zlib compression library.

       USE_NCURSES
              Use the ncurses library.

       USE_SOCK
              Use sockets to transfer mail by POP3 and SMTP.

       USE_WINGUI
              Use the Win32 GUI.

       HAVE_GETDOMAINNAME
              The getdomainname(2) function is available.

              address if AUTOREPLY is set.

       reply.txt
              Help file sent in response to replies to  anonymous
              messages if AUTOREPLY is set.

       usage.txt
              Help  file sent in response to non-remailer message
              sent  to  REMAILERADDR  if  AUTOREPLY  is  set.  If

MIX(1)                                                     MIX(1)


       dest.blk
              List  of  blocked destination addresses.  Mixmaster
              does not send mail to the blocked addresses  listed
              in this file.

       source.blk
              List  of  blocked source addresses.  If an incoming
              message originates from an address in this list, it
              will  be ignored. This feature can be used to avoid
              spam and other abusive mail.

       header.blk
              List of unwanted header fields. The file is used to
              delete unwanted header lines (e.g. lines that indi­
              cate a false identity, or Usenet control messages),
              and do other header filtering.

       A  destination  address  or  header line is left out if it
       contains a search string or matches a  regular  expression
       specified  in the block file. Lines in the block file that
       begin and end with a slash (/regexp/) are  interpreted  as
       regular  expressions.  Lines  without slashes are used for
       case-independent substring search.

       If a message contains a header line that matches  a  /reg­
       exp/q  entry in header.blk, the entire message is deleted.

       In addition, regular expressions can be substituted. Back­
       references are supported. For example

        /^From: *([^@]*) <.*>/From: $1/
        /^From:.* \(([^@]*)/From: $1/
        /^From: *([^@]*).*$/From: $1 <nobody@remailer.domain>/

       would  allow  user-defined  names in the From: line, while
       replacing any given address with the remailer address.

   Mixmaster uses the following files internally:
       mixrand.bin
              Random seed file.

       secrets.mix
